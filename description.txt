Dear Student,

You have been admitted to the course ‘Primate Social Behaviour’ (code B-MPCEMD), taught by Prof. Frans de Waal. As mentioned before, this course consists of 3 lectures, with the first lecture given on Wednesday 2nd June. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, however, Prof. de Waal needs to teach from Atlanta (USA), where he lives. In order for you to follow this course online, we have made the following adjustments to the course:

Lectures are recorded in advance. These will be made available to you through a video link. Details will be shared with you once the video link is set up.
NB: the lectures contain copyrighted material, and online viewing rights for these lectures are ONLY granted to UU students that follow the course B-MPCEMD 2020-2021. It is prohibited to distribute the lectures, or any content thereof, to other parties.

On the day of the lecture, we will have a LIVE discussion in Teams about the lecture topic with prof de Waal. For this, you are expected to have watched the pre-recorded lecture and to have read the accompanying reading material BEFORE we start with this discussion. This discussion will take place from 16h00 – 16h45 in Teams. Attending this discussion is obligatory: please be present online latest at 15h55.
To attend the online discussion,  you need to join a virtual classroom in the program MS Teams, which is freely downloadable for all UU students. For info on how to download and install MS Teams onto your computer and on how to join a classroom, please follow the following link: https://manuals.uu.nl/en/handleiding/teams-online-onderwijs-student . Once you have downloaded and installed MS Teams on your computer, the code you need for joining the classroom (Primate Social Skills) in MS Teams is 9tmtd4x. On the discussion days, you will be invited by me to join a ‘discussion meeting’ in this Team.

In order to facilitate a lively but streamlined live discussion, you can already post questions regarding the lecture or compulsory reading material (see below) in the ‘posts’ section of the MS Teams classroom before the discussion starts. This allows me and prof. de Waal to check your questions in advance and coordinate the discussion properly. Of course, questions can also be posted in the ‘posts’ function during the discussion or asked live.
NB: the right to attend the online discussion is granted only to those UU students following the course B-MPCEMD 2020-2021. Further distribution of the content of this discussion in any form is not allowed.

The course will be finished with a digital exam, for which the online assessment program Remindo is used. The exam will be on Campus. For those people who cannot attend the exam on campus due to any covid related restrictions, the exam can be taken from your home environment. For this, proctoring is compulsory. More information on the details for examination will follow in due course.
 

The lectures will be given according to the following time schedule:
